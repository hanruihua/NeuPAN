## Introduction

**NeuPAN** (Neural Proximal Alternating-minimization Network) is an **end-to-end**, **real-time**, **map-free**, and **easy-to-deploy** MPC based robot motion planner. By integrating learning-based and optimization-based techniques, **NeuPAN directly maps obstacle points data to control actions in real-time** by solving an end-to-end mathematical model with numerous point-level collision avoidance constraints. This eliminates middle modules design to avoid error propagation and achieves high accuracy, allowing the robot to navigate in cluttered and unknown environments efficiently and safely.

> [!NOTE]
> *The pretrained DUNE model provided in these examples are trained under the size of the robot. If you adjust the size of the robot, you must retrain the DUNE model by referring to the [DUNE Training]([#dune-model-training-for-your-own-robot](https://github.com/hanruihua/NeuPAN/tree/main/example/dune_train)) example.*

> [!NOTE]
> *Since the optimization solver cvxpy is not supported on GPU, we recommend using the CPU device to run the NeuPAN algorithm. Thus, the hardware platform with more powerful CPU (e.g. Intel i7) is recommended to achieve higher frequency and better performance. However, you can still use the GPU device to train the DUNE model for acceleration.*

## DUNE Model Training for Your Own Robot with a Specific Convex Geometry

To train a DUNE model for your own robot with a specific convex geometry, you can refer to the [example/dune_train](https://github.com/hanruihua/NeuPAN/tree/main/example/dune_train) folder. Specifically, the convex geometry is defined in the `robot` section by the `vertices` (or `length` and `width` for rectangle) when the robot is in the initial state (coordinate origin). The training parameters can be adjusted in the `train` section. Generally, the training time is approximately 1-2 hours for a new robot geometry.

You can use the `train` section in YAML file to set the training parameters for the DUNE model. The parameters are shown below:

## ROS Wrapper

We provide a ROS wrapper for NeuPAN. You can refer to the [neupan_ros](https://github.com/hanruihua/neupan_ros) repo to see the details. The Gazebo demonstrations are shown below:

## Notes for Real World Deployment

- You can easily deploy the NeuPAN algorithm on a real robot platform using [neupan_ros](https://github.com/hanruihua/neupan_ros). Currently, NeuPAN supports the kinematics of differential drive robots and Ackermann robots (see the `robot` section in the YAML file). For robots with other kinematics, you can modify the constraints in the NRMP layer to suit your needs.

- The DUNE model trained in simulation can be directly applied in the real world without retraining.

- NeuPAN solves the mathematical optimization problem in real time. Thus, its performance is influenced by three main factors: 1) the computing power of the CPU-based hardware platform; 2) the adjustment of the parameters in the `adjust` section; and 3) the naive initial path provided by the user.

- We recommend using a hardware platform with a powerful CPU to enable NeuPAN to run at a control frequency higher than 10 Hz. You can run the provided examples to observe the forward time cost of NeuPAN. To reduce this cost, adjust parameters such as `receding`, `nrmp_max_num`, `dune_max_num`, `iter_num`, and `iter_threshold` to make NeuPAN run faster. In our experience, an Intel i7 CPU is capable of running NeuPAN at a control frequency higher than 15 Hz.

- The `adjust` parameters are used to tune the weights of the state cost, speed cost, and collision avoidance cost. These parameters influence NeuPAN's behavior, making it either more aggressive or more conservative. You can adjust or train these parameters to achieve better performance for your specific workspace. Additionally, these parameters can be fine-tuned in real time for different scenarios.

- The naive initial path can be generated from the provided waypoints or derived from a global planner like A* without accounting for obstacles. This path serves as a simple, rough initial guess for NeuPAN. We offer functionality to generate the initial path from given waypoints as either:
  - direct lines for differential drive robots,
  - Dubins' paths for forward Ackermann vehicles, or
  - Reeds-Shepp paths for forward and backward Ackermann vehicles.


## FAQ:

### Can I use 3D lidar or other sensors such as camera to run this algorithm?

Yes. NeuPAN algorithm is designed to read the 2D points as obstacles to avoid. You can use any sensors to get these points and feed them to NeuPAN. For 3D lidar, you can convert the 3D points to 2D space by projecting them onto the ground plane (e.g., [pointcloud_to_laserscan](http://wiki.ros.org/pointcloud_to_laserscan)); For camera, you can extract the 2D points from the camera image. 

### How to run NeuPAN on my own robot with a specific kinematics?

Currently, NeuPAN only supports the kinematics of differential drive robots (`diff`) and Ackermann robots (`acker`). If you want to use other kinematics, you can modify the [kinematic constraints](https://github.com/hanruihua/NeuPAN/blob/main/neupan/robot/robot.py#L188) in the NRMP layer to suit your needs. We also welcome contributions to support more kinematics by PR or issues. You can test the performance in the ir-sim environments.

### When should I retrain the DUNE model? 

You only need to retrain the DUNE model when you change the robot size or shape. Except that, changing the sensors or the scenarios will not influence the performance of the DUNE model. 

### What is the most important parameter to train DUNE?

Before training the DUNE model, you should confirm the robot geometry (vertices or length and width for rectangle) in the `robot` section is correct. Additionally, `data_range` in train section is also important, which is decided by the maximum range of the obstacle points you want to consider.

### How can I integrate NeuPAN with other global planners such as A*?

You can update the initial path from other global planners in real time by the function [set_initial_path](https://github.com/hanruihua/NeuPAN/blob/main/neupan/neupan.py#L286C9-L286C25). For neupan_ros, you can use the topic `/initial_path` and set the `refresh_initial_path` to be True to read the initial path from other global planners.
